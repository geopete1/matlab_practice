testing a repository with jfpa

We are trying to understand cloning, forking, merging, and all of the other goodies in GitHub.
Currently, we have two collaborators: geopete1 and jfpa
This is the extent of the readme instructions as of 2016-06-09, 17:59 EDT

Trying to update the readme file 5 years later.

Note from F/02-12-2021
Here's how it's done - modify in the sandbox (locally), commit the changes 
to the local repository, then push the version from the local repository 
to the remote repository (repo).
